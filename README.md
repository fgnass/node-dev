# node-dev

Node-dev is a development tool for [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) that automatically restarts the node process when a script is modified.

It's an alternative to tools like [supervisor](https://github.com/isaacs/node-supervisor) or [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) that doesn't require any configuration. Just run `node-dev foo.js` as you would normally run `node` and it will automatically figure out which files need to be watched.

You may also use node-dev with [CoffeeScript](http://http://coffeescript.org/) or [LiveScript](http://livescript.net/) apps. Just run `node-dev app.coffee` or `node-dev app.ls`. You may also register additional language flavors by adding them to the extensions list in your [.node-dev.json](#settings) config file.


Desktop Notifications
=====================

Status and error messages can be displayed as desktop notification using either [Growl](http://growl.info/about.php) or [libnotify](http://developer.gnome.org/libnotify/).

Installation
============

Node-dev can be installed via [npm](http://github.com/isaacs/npm):

    npm install -g node-dev

In order to use Growl notifications [growlnotify](http://growl.info/extras.php#growlnotify) must be installed on your system.

To use OSX's built in notifications:

    sudo gem install terminal-notifier

Settings
========

Upon startup node-dev looks for a `.node-dev.json` file in the user's HOME directory. It will also look for a `.node-dev.json` file in the current directory which – if present – overwrites the global settings.

* __vm__ – Whether to watch files loaded via Node's [VM](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/vm.html) module. _Default:_ `true`
* __fork__ – Whether to hook into [child_process.fork()](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_fork_modulepath_args_options) which is required for [clustered](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/cluster.html) programs. _Default:_ `true`
* __notify__ – Whether to display desktop notifications. _Default:_ `true`
* __timestamp__ – The timestamp format to use for logging restarts. _Default:_ `"HH:MM:ss"`
* __clear__ – Whether to clear the screen upon restarts. _Default:_ `false`
* __extensions__ – Modules to load based bad on extension of the main script. _Default:_
  `{ coffee: "coffee-script", ls: "LiveScript" }`
