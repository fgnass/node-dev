# node-dev-env

Node-dev-env is a development tool for [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) that
automatically restarts the node process when a script is modified.

It's an alternative to tools like
[supervisor](https://github.com/isaacs/node-supervisor) or
[nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) that doesn't require any
configuration. Just run `node-dev-env foo.js` as you would normally run `node` and
it will automatically figure out which files need to be watched.

You may also use node-dev with [CoffeeScript](http://http://coffeescript.org/)
or [LiveScript](http://livescript.net/) apps. Just run `node-dev-env app.coffee`
or `node-dev-env app.ls`. You may also register additional language flavors by
adding them to the extensions list in your [.node-dev.json](#settings) config
file.

__Note:__ this is a fork from fgnass/node-dev because I needed the ability to set env vars in the config file and could not wait for the changes to be merged

### Desktop Notifications

Status and error messages can be displayed as desktop notification using either
[Growl](http://growl.info/about.php) or
[libnotify](http://developer.gnome.org/libnotify/).

### Installation

Node-dev can be installed via [npm](http://github.com/isaacs/npm):

    npm install -g node-dev-env

In order to use Growl notifications
[growlnotify](http://growl.info/extras.php#growlnotify) must be installed on
your system.

To use OSX's built in notifications:

    sudo gem install terminal-notifier

### Settings

Upon startup node-dev looks for a `.node-dev.json` file in the user's HOME
directory. It will also look for a `.node-dev.json` file in the current
directory which – if present – overwrites the global settings.

* __vm__ – Whether to watch files loaded via Node's [VM](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/vm.html) module. _Default:_ `true`
* __fork__ – Whether to hook into [child_process.fork()](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_fork_modulepath_args_options) which is required for [clustered](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/cluster.html) programs. _Default:_ `true`
* __notify__ – Whether to display desktop notifications. _Default:_ `true`
* __timestamp__ – The timestamp format to use for logging restarts. _Default:_ `"HH:MM:ss"`
* __clear__ – Whether to clear the screen upon restarts. _Default:_ `false`
* __extensions__ – Modules to load based bad on extension of the main script. _Default:_
